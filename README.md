# Doing Linear Classification with Computational Geometry
This project aims to use `computational geometry` algorithms to create a `linear classification` model, which uses a straight line to classify data points into two categories.

## Implementation objectives
- A Convex Hull algorithm
- A Sweep-Line Segment Intersection algorithm
- A Closest Pair of Points algorithm
- Find the classification line
- Evaluate with metrics 10 datasets from online databases

**Steps:** Starting from a training dataset, the algorithm must find an envelope (boundary) that delimits a classification region for a dataset (points in the Cartesian plane). From two of these envelopes, it will be possible to determine if there is separability (or if they have overlapping areas) and then determine a line that separates the two datasets.
